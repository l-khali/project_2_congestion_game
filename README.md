# Project 2: Congestion Game

We consider an iterated best response approach to find equilibria of a 10 player congestion game with player specific cost function. This is also extended to the splittable flow case by increasing the number of players, while keeping the mass constant. 

The code for the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_2_congestion_game/blob/main/functions.py), and the results can be found [here](https://github.com/l-khali/project_2_congestion_game/blob/main/results.ipynb).
